# Examples

This folder contains some example type 0 SMF files that you can use to test the firmware. The MIDI files themselves are `*.mid`, and in some cases a `*.hex` file is also provided explaining the contents of the MIDI file.

| **File**            | **Description**                                          |

| `scale` | Middle C scale. This is good to understand the format, as the MIDI messages follow a pattern. |
